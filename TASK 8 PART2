What a Dashboard Provides (Simple Explanations)
🧭 1. Business Overview
Dashboards give a quick, visual summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales, profit, and regional performance. This helps decision-makers understand business health at a glance.

📊 2. Trend Analysis
By showing Sales over Time, dashboards help identify:

Peak sales months

Seasonality or holiday spikes

Slow periods where sales drop

Example:

“Sales peaked in November, likely due to holiday shopping season.”

🌍 3. Regional Comparison
Bar charts or maps allow you to compare how different regions perform.

Example:

“The West region outperformed all others consistently across the year.”

🛍 4. Product/Category Insights
Donut or pie charts can show how different categories contribute to total sales.

Example:

“Technology accounts for 45% of total revenue, making it the most important category.”

🎛 5. User Interaction
Slicers and filters allow users to:

View data by Region

Analyze specific product categories

Focus on specific months or quarters

This interactivity helps users get custom insights.

🎯 6. Decision Support
Dashboards are not just for viewing — they support actions like:
